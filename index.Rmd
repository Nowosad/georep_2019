# Geocomputation with R

An important feature of R (and Python) is that it is an interpreted language. This is advantageous because it enables interactive programming in a Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL): code entered into the console is immediately executed and the result is printed, rather than waiting for the intermediate stage of compilation. 

R packages:

- **sf**, **raster** - spatial classes
- **dplyr**, **rmapshaper** - processing of atttribute tables/geometries 
- **rnaturalearth**, **osmdata**, **getlandsat** - spatial data download
- **rgrass7**, **RQGIS**, **RSAGA**, **link2GI** - connecting with GIS software
- **gstat**, **mlr**, **CAST** - spatial data modeling
- **rasterVis**, **tmap**, **ggplot** - static visualizations
- **leaflet**, **mapview**, **mapdeck** - interactive visualizations
- many more...

# Transportation analysis

---
# Introduction

> The purpose of transportation is to overcome space (Rodrigue, Comtois, and Slack 2013)

- Transport involves traversing continuous geographic space between A and B, and infinite localities in between
- **The purpose of geographic transport modeling is simplifying the complexity in a way that captures the essence of transport problems**
- Selecting an appropriate level of geographic analysis can help simplify this complexity

<!-- about transportation -->

---
# Introduction

The geographic analysis of transport systems could be done at different geographic levels, including:

- **Areal units**: transport patterns can be understood with reference to zonal aggregates such as the main mode of travel (by car, bike or foot, for example) and the average distance of trips made by people living in a particular zone
- **Desire lines**: straight lines that represent ‘origin-destination’ data that records how many people travel (or could travel) between places (points or zones) in geographic space
- **Routes**: these are lines representing a path along the route network along the desire lines defined in the previous bullet point
- **Nodes**: these are points in the transport system that can represent common origins and destinations and public transport stations such as bus stops and rail stations
- **Route networks**: these represent the system of roads, paths and other linear features in an area. They can be represented as geographic features (representing route segments) or structured as an interconnected graph, with the level of traffic on different segments referred to as ‘flow’ by transport modelers

# Bristol

.pull-left[
Typically, models are designed to solve a particular problem.
- **Bristol - a city in the west of England with a population of half a million people**
- In terms of transport, Bristol is well served by rail and road links and has a relatively high level of active travel. 19% of its citizens' cycle and 88% walk at least once per month according to the Active People Survey (the national average is 15% and 81%, respectively).
- 8% of the population said they cycled work in the 2011 census, compared with only 3% nationwide
- Despite impressive walking and cycling statistics, **the city has a major congestion problem**

# Aims

.pull-left[
- For this reason, the question is **how best to increase the share of walking and cycling in the city of Bristol?**

This high-level aim will be met via the following objectives:

- Describe the geographical pattern of transport behavior in the city
- Identify key public transport nodes and routes along which cycling to rail stations could be encouraged, as the first stage in multi-model trips
- Analyze travel ‘desire lines’, to find where many people drive short distances
- Identify cycle route locations that will encourage less car driving and more cycling

# Transportation zones

Two zone types will typically be of particular interest:

- **origin** (typically residential areas) zones
- **destination** (typically containing ‘trip attractors’ such as offices, schools, and shops) zones

The origin and destination zones used here are officially defined zones of intermediate geographic resolution (their official name is Middle layer Super Output Areas or MSOAs). Each houses around 8,000 people

# Desire lines

- Unlike zones, which represent trip origins and destinations, **desire lines connect the centroid of the origin and the destination zone**, and thereby represent where people desire to go between zones
- They represent the quickest ‘crow flies’ route between A and B that would be taken, if it were not for obstacles such as buildings and windy roads getting in the way

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
od_inter = filter(bristol_od, o != d)

# Desire lines

- **The map shows that the city center dominates transport patterns in the region, suggesting policies should be prioritized there**, although a number of peripheral sub-centers can also be seen 
- Next, it would be interesting to have a look at the distribution of interzonal modes, e.g. between which zones is cycling the least mean of transport

# Routes

- **Routes are desire lines that are no longer straight**
- **Routes are generated from desire lines** — or more commonly origin-destination pairs — **using routing services**
- The benefits of cycling trips are greatest when they replace car trips
- **5 km Euclidean distance (or around 6-8 km of route distance) can realistically be cycled by many people**
- We will therefore only route desire lines along which a high (300+) number of car trips take place that are up to 5 km in distance:

```{r, message=FALSE}
desire_lines$distance = as.numeric(st_length(desire_lines))
desire_carshort = dplyr::filter(desire_lines, car_driver > 300 & distance < 5000)
route_carshort = line2route(desire_carshort, route_fun = route_osrm)
```

---
# Routes

.pull-left[
- **Plotting the results shows that many short car trips take place in and around Bradley Stoke**
- Why? Bradley Stoke is “Europe’s largest new town built with private investment”, suggesting limited public transport provision
- Furthermore, the town is surrounded by large (cycling unfriendly) road structures, “such as junctions on both the M4 and M5 motorways” 
]

.pull-right[
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

---
# Nodes

.pull-left[
- Nodes in geographic transport data are zero-dimensional features (points)
- From an active travel perspective, public transport ‘legs’ of longer journeys divide trips into three:

   * **The origin leg**, typically from residential areas to public transport stations
   * **The public transport leg**, which typically goes from the station nearest a trip’s origin to the station nearest its destination
   * **The destination leg**, from the station of alighting to the destination
]

.pull-right[
- We will use railway stations to illustrate public transport nodes

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tm_shape(bristol_stations) +
  tm_symbols(col = "blue")
```
] 


 
---
# Nodes

- As an example, we will select only the top three desire lines in terms of rails use:

```{r}
desire_rail = top_n(desire_lines, n = 3, wt = train)
```

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
tm_shape(desire_rail) + tm_lines()
```
</center>

---
# Nodes

- The challenge now is to ‘break-up’ each of these lines into three pieces, representing travel via public transport nodes:

```{r}
desire_rail = line_via(desire_rail, bristol_stations)
```

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
zone_cents = st_centroid(zones_od)
zone_cents_rail = zone_cents[desire_rail, ]
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(bristol_stations, is.master = TRUE) +
  tm_symbols(col = NA, shape = 19)+ 
  tm_shape(zone_cents_rail) +
  tm_symbols(col = "black", size = 0.25) +
  tm_shape(desire_rail$geometry) +
  tm_lines(col = "black") +
  tm_shape(desire_rail$leg_orig) + 
  tm_lines(col = "green") +  
  tm_shape(desire_rail$leg_via) +
  tm_lines(col = "grey") +  
  tm_shape(desire_rail$leg_dest) +
  tm_lines(col = "blue") 
```
</center>
---
# Route networks

- Route networks can usefully be represented as mathematical graphs, with nodes on the network connected by edges
- As an example, we will select only the roads with maximum speed of 70 mph (~113 km/h) :

```{r}
ways_freeway = bristol_ways %>% filter(maxspeed == "70 mph") 
```
<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tm_shape(ways_freeway) +
  tm_lines(col = "purple", lwd = 2)
```
</center>

---
# Route networks

- In the example below,below, the ‘edge betweenness’, meaning the number of shortest paths passing through each edge, is calculated:

```
ways_sln = SpatialLinesNetwork(ways_freeway)
ways_sln@sl$e = igraph::edge_betweenness(ways_sln@g)
```

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(ways_sln@sl) + 
  tm_lines(lwd = "e", scale = 25) +
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE)
```
</center>

# Prioritizing new infrastructure

.pull-left[
```{r}
route_rail = desire_rail %>% 
  st_set_geometry("leg_orig") %>% 
  line2route(route_fun = route_osrm) %>% 
  st_set_crs(4326)
route_cycleway = rbind(route_rail, route_carshort)
route_cycleway$all = c(desire_rail$all, 
                       desire_carshort$all)
```

# Future directions of travel

.pull-left[
- **The presented foundations can be extended by including more variables in the analysis**
- **Characteristics of the route** such as speed limits, busyness and the provision of protected cycling and walking paths **could be linked to the proportion of trips made by different modes of transport**
- By aggregating OpenStreetMap data using buffers and geographic data methods, **it would be possible to detect the presence of green space in close proximity to transport routes**
- Using R’s statistical modeling capabilities, this could then be used **to predict current and future levels of cycling**
- This type of analysis underlies **the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT)**, a publicly accessible (see www.pct.bike) mapping tool developed in R that is being used to prioritize investment in cycling across England
