# Geocomputation with R

An important feature of R (and Python) is that it is an interpreted language. This is advantageous because it enables interactive programming in a Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL): code entered into the console is immediately executed and the result is printed, rather than waiting for the intermediate stage of compilation. 

R packages:

- **sf**, **raster** - spatial classes
- **dplyr**, **rmapshaper** - processing of atttribute tables/geometries 
- **rnaturalearth**, **osmdata**, **getlandsat** - spatial data download
- **rgrass7**, **RQGIS**, **RSAGA**, **link2GI** - connecting with GIS software
- **gstat**, **mlr**, **CAST** - spatial data modeling
- **rasterVis**, **tmap**, **ggplot** - static visualizations
- **leaflet**, **mapview**, **mapdeck** - interactive visualizations
- many more...

# Transportation analysis

---
# Introduction

> The purpose of transportation is to overcome space (Rodrigue, Comtois, and Slack 2013)

- Transport involves traversing continuous geographic space between A and B, and infinite localities in between
- The purpose of geographic transport modeling is simplifying the complexity in a way that captures the essence of transport problems
- Selecting an appropriate level of geographic analysis can help simplify this complexity

<!-- about transportation -->

---
# Introduction

The geographic analysis of transport systems could be done at different geographic levels, including:

- **Areal units**: transport patterns can be understood with reference to zonal aggregates such as the main mode of travel (by car, bike or foot, for example) and average distance of trips made by people living in a particular zone
- **Desire lines**: straight lines that represent ‘origin-destination’ data that records how many people travel (or could travel) between places (points or zones) in geographic space
- **Routes**: these are lines representing a path along the route network along the desire lines defined in the previous bullet point
- **Nodes**: these are points in the transport system that can represent common origins and destinations and public transport stations such as bus stops and rail stations
- **Route networks**: these represent the system of roads, paths and other linear features in an area. They can be represented as geographic features (representing route segments) or structured as an interconnected graph, with the level of traffic on different segments referred to as ‘flow’ by transport modelers

<!-- different geographic levels -->

# Bristol

.pull-left[
- Typically, models are designed to solve a particular problem.
- Bristol, a city in the west of England, around 30 km east of the Welsh capital Cardiff.
- Bristol is the 10th largest city council in England, with a population of half a million people
- In terms of transport, Bristol is well served by rail and road links, and has a relatively high level of active travel. 19% of its citizens cycle and 88% walk at least once per month according to the Active People Survey (the national average is 15% and 81%, respectively). 8% of the population said they cycled work in the 2011 census, compared with only 3% nationwide.
- Despite impressive walking and cycling statistics, the city has a major congestion problem. Part of the solution is to continue to increase the proportion of trips made by cycling.

# Aims

.pull-left[
- For this reason, this chapter is based around a policy scenario, introduced in the next section, that asks: how to increase cycling in the city of Bristol? 

Beyond demonstrating how geocomputation with R can be used to support sustainable transport planning, is to provide evidence for decision-makers in Bristol to decide how best to increase the share of walking and cycling in particular in the city. This high-level aim will be met via the following objectives:

- Describe the geographical pattern of transport behavior in the city.
- Identify key public transport nodes and routes along which cycling to rail stations could be encouraged, as the first stage in multi-model trips.
- Analyze travel ‘desire lines’ to, to find where many people drive short distances.
- Identify cycle route locations that will encourage less car driving and more cycling.

# Transportation zones

- Two zone types will typically be of particular interest: the study region and origin (typically residential areas) and destination (typically containing ‘trip attractors’ such as schools and shops) zones.
- The origin and destination zones used in this chapter are the same: officially defined zones of intermediate geographic resolution (their official name is Middle layer Super Output Areas or MSOAs). Each houses around 8,000 people.

# Desire lines

- Unlike zones, which represent trip origins and destinations, desire lines connect the centroid of the origin and the destination zone, and thereby represent where people desire to go between zones. They represent the quickest ‘bee line’ or ‘crow flies’ route between A and B that would be taken, if it were not for obstacles such as buildings and windy roads getting in the way

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bristol_od$Active = (bristol_od$bicycle + bristol_od$foot) /
  bristol_od$all * 100
od_inter = filter(bristol_od, o != d)
desire_lines = od2line(od_inter, zones_od)
```

---
# Desire lines

.lc[
The map shows that the city center dominates transport patterns in the region, suggesting policies should be prioritized there, although a number of peripheral sub-centers can also be seen. Next it would be interesting to have a look at the distribution of interzonal modes, e.g. between which zones is cycling the least or the most common means of transport.

# Future directions of travel

Methodologically, the foundations presented in this chapter could be extended by including more variables in the analysis. Characteristics of the route such as speed limits, busyness and the provision of protected cycling and walking paths could be linked to ‘mode-split’ (the proportion of trips made by different modes of transport). By aggregating OpenStreetMap data using buffers and geographic data methods presented in Chapters 3 and 4, for example, it would be possible to detect the presence of green space in close proximity to transport routes. Using R’s statistical modeling capabilities, this could then be used to predict current and future levels of cycling, for example.

# Geomarketing

- Typical example is where to locate a new shop. The aim here is to attract most visitors and, ultimately, make most profit
- There are also many non-commercial applications that can use the technique for public benefit, for example where to locate new health services
- Typical research questions include what are the target groups, where do target groups live and which areas do they frequent, where are competing stores or services located?

- To answer such questions you can:
    - Tidy the input data from a census
    - Convert the tabulated census data into raster objects
    - Identify metropolitan areas with high population densities
    - Download detailed geographic data (from OpenStreetMap, with `osmdata`) for these areas
    - Create rasters for scoring the relative desirability of different locations using map algebra

This brings us to the ‘open source approach’, which has three main components:

- A command-line interface (CLI), encouraging scripts recording geographic work to be shared and reproduced
- Open source software, which can be inspected and potentially improved by anyone in the world
- An active developer community, which collaborates and self-organizes to build complimentary and modular tools
